# Hi there!!
:hand: :hand:

Trying to merge Data Science, mathematics, programming with a not such numeric world as it is Sociology, how countries developed or how natural disaster or a war may affect this countries, the idea is to try an approach of Machine Learning to those problems.
Here in GitHub or Kaggle we are used to Artificial Intelligence or Deep Learning but not that much to more humanistics approaches.

This is "my very humble personal try" to bring this worlds togethers and probe that this is also a way to use Data Science and all its possibilities.
