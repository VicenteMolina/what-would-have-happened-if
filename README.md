# Hi there!!
:hand: :hand:

Trying to merge Data Science, mathematics, programming with a not such numeric world as it is Sociology, how countries developed or how natural disaster or a war may affect this countries, the idea is to try an approach of Machine Learning to those problems.
Here in GitHub or Kaggle we are used to Artificial Intelligence or Deep Learning but not that much to more humanistics approaches.

Through all the known history of our world, many events have changed the long thread of history. But, as history is past events, and not yet has been revealed a way to travel to the past, people like to dream and play about what would have happened if...that asteroid never crashed to the earth when the dinosaurs...or if Figo had never moved from Barcelona to Real Madrid.

Well, let's play sci-fi with our new friend Data Science and its applications. But let's also move to a more serious issue that is very close to our present life, and that involves millions of people: the Civil War in Syria. 

This is "my very humble personal try" to bring this worlds togethers and probe that this is also a way to use Data Science and all its possibilities.
