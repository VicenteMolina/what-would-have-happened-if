# Hi there!!
:hand: :hand:

Trying to merge Data Science, mathematics, programming with a not such numeric world as it is Sociology, how countries developed or how natural disaster or a war may affect this countries, the idea is to try an approach of Machine Learning to those problems.
Here in GitHub or Kaggle we are used to Artificial Intelligence or Deep Learning but not that much to more humanistics approaches.

Through all the known history of our world, many events have changed the long thread of history. But, as history is past events, and not yet has been revealed a way to travel to the past, people like to dream and play about what would have happened if...that asteroid never crashed to the earth when the dinosaurs...or if Figo had never moved from Barcelona to Real Madrid.

Well, let's play sci-fi with our new friend Data Science and its applications. But let's also move to a more serious issue that is very close to our present life, and that involves millions of people: the Civil War in Syria. 

This is "my very humble personal try" to bring this worlds togethers and probe that this is also a way to use Data Science and all its possibilities.


## Work is divide in two




## A little explanation of why we choose those indicators.

- [x] **Air transport of passengers:** Sample of quality mobility (high cost) in the interior / exterior of the country.
Total number of people in the armed forces Their number shows the threat situation of the environment and the budget dedicated to "defense". It is clear that the threat in Syria, located in a very conflictive zone, is much higher than that of Bolivia or Morocco.
- [x] **CO2 Emissions (Kt)**: New indicator that can explain the development situation of a country. More emissions / more industry / more energy consumption of the population.
- [x] **Goods and services exportation (Current US)**: It serves to assess in relation to what is purchased, the trade balance. If you sell more than purchases, you have a better economy.
- [x] **Total external debt balance**: The debt is good (you have a lot or little credit to use) and it is bad (you owe a lot or a little).
- [x] **Fixed broadband suscriptions**: Index of introduction of the ICT. Greater subscription, better communications, more development.
- [x] **GDP (Current US)**:  GDP is the representation of a country, always in relation to its dimensions and socioeconomic characteristics. It has a great value to observe the growth and therefore the positive or negative evolution of a country.
- [x] **Atlas GNI (Us actual)**: All the indicators that are analyzed must be filtered by this. It is decisive in the analysis of future expectations. Political stability, improvements in consumption... are related to inequality.
- [x] **Hospital beds (per 1000 people)**: The health of citizens is a very important factor in their quality of life. And in life expectancy.
- [x] **Goods and services Imports (Current Us)**: See exports.
- [x] **Total labor force**: The labor market of these countries seen from a European perspective is not significant. The “informal” economy dominates. However, the percentage in relation to the active population is always relevant, shows the formality of labor relations.
- [x] **Life expectancy at birth**: Related to the sanitary system. If it is good (beds per inhabitants), life expectancy is greater.
- [x] **Military expenditure**: Like members of the army, if spending is high, it has a negative impact on health and education.
- [x] **Mobile pone suscriptions**: The mobile is the symbol of ICT’s. In the least developed countries, is the popular communication technology.
- [x] **Doctors (per 1000 people)**: Sanitary system, beds….
- [x] **Total population Population pyramid**: If the youngest age groups (0-14, up to 45) are high and those over 65 are lower, demographics are a very positive economic factor |14 YO Range Population |15-64 YO Range Population |65 YO or more Range Population 
- [x] **Rail transport of passengers (millions ofnpassengers per Km)**: It means mobility of goods and passengers in the interior. More Km or more passengers means more quality of life.
- [x] **Urban/Rural population**: Evolution all over the world is towards the cities. The high rate of rurality is an indicator of low development.
